Really simple script to count Ruby LOC (Line Of Code).

## How to use

_NB: you must have a Go environment up and ready._

```
go run loc_stats.go path/to/ruby/dir
```

## Disclaimer

This is just a toy-project to test Go! There are many better tools to count LOCs so you should continue your search!
